    <p class="lead">It represents a slip of a year in the previously targeted date for the return of humans to the lunar surface that was last achieved in 1972.</p>

    <p> Nasa says the delay to what's known as its Artemis III mission will enable further technology development.</p>

    <h2>Fundamentally, the agency still doesn't have a craft to put astronauts on the Moon or spacesuits they can wear.</h2>

    <p>Announcing the delay, agency administrator Bill Nelson said safety drove all timing considerations.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"We won't fly until we're ready," he told reporters.</p>
